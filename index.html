    <h1>This Website Is To Illustrate The Types Of Data Sets Which Force Diagrams Work Well With</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>What Is A Force Diagram?</h3>
    <p>Force layouts are typically used with network data. In computer science, this kind of
dataset is called a graph. A simple graph is a list of nodes and edges. The nodes are
entities in the dataset, and the edges are the connections between nodes. Some nodes
will be connected by edges, and others wonâ€™t. Nodes are commonly represented as
circles, and edges as lines. <p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p><img href="force.jpeg"></p>
    <h3>Set One:</h3>
    <p>Data which consists of different cities and the distance between the cities would be a good set of data for force
    diagrams. This data would work well as the cities would be represented by each cirle of the force diagram and 
    the distance would be represented by the connecting edge. </p>
    <h3>Set Two:</h3>
    <p>Data which consists of a social media user's friends, and their friends friends would also be a good set of data for
    a force diagram. The force diagram would show the interconnections of the friends, highlighting how one users friends are
    often connected to another of the user's friends</p>
    <h3>Set Three:</h3>
    <p>Data which consists the number of exports to and from different countries would also be a set of data well suited for
    a force diagram. The number of exports would determine the edges between each country which would determine each node. 
    This would illustrate the relation between them well.</p>
